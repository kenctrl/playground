I completed this project as part of my data privacy research at Western Connecticut State University, mentored by Prof. Xiaodi Wang. I developed three algorithms that embed noise into datasets to make the data differentially private. Multiple machine learning models were able to achieve high accuracy using noisy data from the three algorithms, proving that the data successfully retain both differential privacy and statistical learnability. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00012).
