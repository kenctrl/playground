[VOCR](https://github.com/chigkim/VOCR/tree/main) is an open-source application that helps visually impaired people navigate MacOS by using VoiceOver for text elements on the screen. We teamed up with Berklee professor Chi Kim to implement a music icon detection feature in VOCR that makes it easier for users to navigate music software such as Pro Tools. We completed this project as part of MITâ€™s Principles and Practice of Assistive Technology [(PPAT)](http://ppat.mit.edu/fall2019/index.html) class.
